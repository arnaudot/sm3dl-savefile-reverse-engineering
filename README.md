# Super Mario 3D Land Save File reverse engineering
by arnaudot_
### This is the first time I've ever done anything close to coding or whatever other than messing with Scratch, so you might say I'm a beginner and you're right! This is a bit of an initiation project for me. I'm really passionate about this game and I just want to do something useful with the years of me playing this game. So, here it is.
### You can use this for whatever you want, but I have planned to do a pretty complete save file viewer and editor, and a way to swap files in Citra, for debugging purposes in ROM hacks and for speedrunners wanting to try new routes easier maybe. 
### The documentation is in [this google drvive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gaW2NUbC8PNr7DPxXGCrmpRT0JqaoR6-?usp=sharing).
### Keep in mind this is not finished! I'm about 20% done but now there are the really hard bits left.
